biology into an outer layer called ectoderm and an inner layer called endoderm. a mesoderm soon appears between the ectoderm and the endoderm. these three layers give rise to all tissues organs in adults. it needs to be mentioned here that the inner cell mass contains certain cells called stem cells which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs. what are the major features of embryonic development at various months of pregnancy the human pregnancy lasts 9 months. do you know for how many months pregnancy last in dogs elephants cats find out. in human beings after one month of pregnancy the embryos heart is formed. the first sign of growing foetus may be noticed by listening to the heart sound carefully through the stethoscope. by the end of the second month of pregnancy the foetus develops limbs and digits. by the end of 12 weeks first trimester most of the major organ systems are formed for example the limbs and external genital organs are well developed. the first movements of the foetus and appearance of hair on the head are usually observed during the fifth month. by the end of about 24 weeks end of second trimester the body is covered with fine hair eyelids separate and eyelashes are formed. by the end of nine months of pregnancy the foetus is fully developed and is ready for delivery. 2.7 parturition and lactation the average duration of human pregnancy is about 9 months which is called the gestation period. vigorous contraction of the uterus at the end of pregnancy causes expulsiondelivery of the foetus. this process of delivery of the foetus childbirth is called parturition. parturition is induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism. the signals for parturition originate from the fully developed foetus and the placenta which induce mild uterine contractions called foetal ejection reflex. this triggers release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary. oxytocin acts on the uterine muscle and causes stronger uterine contractions which in turn stimulates further secretion of oxytocin. the stimulatory reflex between the uterine contraction and oxytocin secretion continues resulting in stronger and stronger contractions. this leads to expulsion of the baby out of the uterus through the birth canal parturition. soon after the infant is delivered the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus. what do you think the doctors inject to induce delivery the mammary glands of the female undergo differentiation during pregnancy and starts producing milk towards the end of pregnancy by 38 the process called lactation. this helps the mother in feeding the new born. the milk produced during the initial few days of lactation is called colostrum which contains several antibodies absolutely essential to develop resistance for the newborn babies. breastfeeding during the initial period of infant growth is recommended by doctors for bringing up a healthy baby. rationalised 202324,ed 202324
human reproduction summary humans are sexually reproducing and viviparous. the male reproductive system is composed of a pair of testes the male sex accessory ducts and the accessory glands and external genitalia. each testis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules and each lobule contains one to three highly coiled seminiferous tubules. each seminiferous tubule is lined inside by spermatogonia and sertoli cells. the spermatogonia undergo meiotic divisions leading to sperm formation while sertoli cells provide nutrition to the dividing germ cells. the leydig cells outside the seminiferous tubules synthesise and secrete testicular hormones called androgens. the male external genitalia is called penis. the female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries a pair of oviducts a uterus a vagina external genitalia and a pair of mammary glands. the ovaries produce the female gamete ovum and some steroid hormones ovarian hormones. ovarian follicles in different stages of development are embedded in the stroma. the oviducts uterus and vagina are female accessory ducts. the uterus has three layers namely perimetrium myometrium and endometrium. the female external genitalia includes mons pubis labia majora labia minora hymen and clitoris. the mammary glands are one of the female secondary sexual characteristics. spermatogenesis results in the formation of sperms that are transported by the male sex accessory ducts. a normal human sperm is composed of a head neck a middle piece and tail. the process of formation of mature female gametes is called oogenesis. the reproductive cycle of female primates is called menstrual cycle. menstrual cycle starts only after attaining sexual maturation puberty. during ovulation only one ovum is released per menstrual cycle. the cyclical changes in the ovary and the uterus during menstrual cycle are induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones. after coitus sperms are transported to the ampulla where the sperm fertilises the ovum leading to formation of a diploid zygote. the presence of x or y chromosome in the sperm determines the sex of the embryo. the zygote undergoes repeated mitotic division to form a blastocyst which is implanted in the uterus resulting in pregnancy. after nine months of pregnancy the fully developed foetus is ready for delivery. the process of childbirth is called parturition which is induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism involving cortisol estrogens and oxytocin. mammary glands differentiate during pregnancy and secrete milk after childbirth. the newborn baby is fed milk by the mother lactation during the initial few months of growth. exercises 39 1. fill in the blanks a humans reproduce asexuallysexually b humans are oviparous viviparous ovoviviparous c fertilisation is in humans externalinternal d male and female gametes are diploidhaploid e zygote is diploidhaploid rationalised 202324,"Human Reproduction, Male Reproductive System"
