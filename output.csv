45,the edges of the infundibulum possess fingerlike projections called fimbriae which help in collection of the ovum after ovulation
46,the infundibulum leads to a wider 29 figure 23 b diagrammatic sectional view of the female reproductive system rationalised 202324
47,biology part of the oviduct called ampulla
48,the last part of the oviduct isthmus has a narrow lumen and it joins the uterus
49,the uterus is single and it is also called womb
50,the shape of the uterus is like an inverted pear
51,it is supported by ligaments attached to the pelvic wall
52,the uterus opens into vagina through a narrow cervix
53,the cavity of the cervix is called cervical canal figure 23b which alongwith vagina forms the birth canal
54,the wall of the uterus has three layers of tissue
55,the external thin membranous perimetrium middle thick layer of smooth muscle myometrium and inner glandular layer called endometrium that lines the uterine cavity
56,the endometrium undergoes cyclical changes during menstrual cycle while the myometrium exhibits strong contraction during delivery of the baby
57,the female external genitalia include mons pubis labia majora labia minora hymen and clitoris figure 23a
58,mons pubis is a cushion of fatty tissue covered by skin and pubic hair
59,the labia majora are fleshy folds of tissue which extend down from the mons pubis and surround the vaginal opening
60,the labia minora are paired folds of tissue under the labia majora
61,the opening of the vagina is often covered partially by a membrane called hymen
62,the clitoris is a tiny fingerlike structure which lies at the upper junction of the two labia minora above the urethral opening
63,the hymen is often torn during the first coitus intercourse
64,however it can also be broken by a sudden fall or jolt insertion of a vaginal tampon active participation in some sports like horseback riding cycling etc
65,in some women the hymen persists even after coitus
66,in fact the presence or absence of hymen is not a reliable indicator of virginity or sexual experience
67,30 figure 24 a diagrammatic sectional view of mammary gland rationalised 202324
68,human reproduction a functional mammary gland is characteristic of all female mammals
69,the mammary glands are paired structures breasts that contain glandular tissue and variable amount of fat
70,the glandular tissue of each breast is divided into 1520 mammary lobes containing clusters of cells called alveoli figure 24
71,the cells of alveoli secrete milk which is stored in the cavities lumens of alveoli
72,the alveoli open into mammary tubules
73,the tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct
74,several mammary ducts join to form a wider mammary ampulla which is connected to lactiferous duct through which milk is sucked out
75,23 g ametogenesis the primary sex organs the testis in the males and the ovaries in the femalesproduce gametes ie sperms and ovum respectively by the process called gametogenesis
76,in testis the immature male germ cells spermatogonia produce sperms by spermatogenesis that begins at puberty
77,the spermatogonia sing
78,spermatogonium present on the inside wall of seminiferous tubules multiply by mitotic division and increase in numbers
79,each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes
80,some of the spermatogonia called primary spermatocytes periodically undergo meiosis
81,a primary spermatocyte completes the first meiotic division reduction division leading to formation of two equal haploid cells called secondary spermatocytes which have only 23 chromosomes each
82,the secondary spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic division to produce four equal haploid spermatids figure 25
83,what would be the number of chromosome in the spermatids
84,the spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa sperms by the process called spermiogenesis
85,after spermiogenesis sperm heads become embedded in the sertoli cells and are finally released from the seminiferous tubules by the process called spermiation
86,spermatogenesis starts at the age of figure 25 diagrammatic sectional view of a puberty due to significant increase in the seminiferous tubule enlarged secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone 31 gnrh
87,this if you recall is a hypothalamic hormone
88,the increased levels of gnrh then acts at the anterior pituitary gland and stimulates secretion of two gonadotropins luteinising hormone lh and follicle stimulating hormone fsh
89,lh acts at the leydig cells and stimulates synthesis and secretion of androgens
90,androgens in turn stimulate the process of spermatogenesis
91,fsh acts on the sertoli cells and stimulates rationalised 202324
92,biology secretion of some factors which help in the process of spermiogenesis
93,let us examine the structure of a sperm
94,it is a microscopic structure composed of a head neck a middle piece and a tail figure 26
95,a plasma membrane envelops the whole body of sperm
96,the sperm head contains an elongated haploid nucleus the anterior portion of which is covered by a caplike structure acrosome
97,the acrosome is filled with enzymes that help fertilisation of the ovum
98,the middle piece possesses numerous mitochondria which produce energy for the movement of tail that facilitate sperm motility essential for fertilisation
99,the human male ejaculates about 200 to 300 million sperms during a coitus of which for normal fertility at least 60 per cent sperms must have normal shape and size and at least 40 per cent of them must show vigorous motility
100,sperms released from the seminiferous figure 26 structure of a sperm tubules are transported by the accessory ducts
101,secretions of epididymis vas deferens seminal vesicle and prostate are essential for maturation and motility of sperms
102,the seminal plasma along with the sperms constitute the semen
103,the functions of male sex accessory ducts and glands are maintained by the testicular hormones androgens
104,the process of formation of a mature female gamete is called oogenesis which is markedly different from spermatogenesis
105,oogenesis is initiated during the embryonic development stage when a couple of million gamete mother cells oogonia are formed within each fetal ovary no more oogonia are formed and added after birth
106,these cells start division and enter into prophasei of the meiotic division and get temporarily arrested at that stage called primary oocytes
107,each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells and is called the primary follicle figure 27
108,a large number of these follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to puberty
109,therefore at puberty only 6000080000 primary follicles are left in each ovary
110,the primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of granulosa cells and a new theca and are called secondary follicles
111,32 the secondary follicle soon transforms into a tertiary follicle which is characterised by a fluid filled cavity called antrum
112,the theca layer is organised into an inner theca interna and an outer theca externa
113,it is important to draw your attention that it is at this stage that the primary oocyte within the tertiary follicle grows in size and completes its first meiotic division
114,it is an unequal division resulting in the formation of a large haploid secondary oocyte and a tiny first polar body figure 28b
115,the rationalised 202324
116,human reproduction secondary oocyte retains bulk of the nutrient rich cytoplasm of the primary oocyte
117,can you think of any advantage for this
118,does the first polar body born out of first meiotic division divide further or degenerate
119,at present we are not very certain about this
120,the tertiary follicle further changes into the mature follicle or graafian follicle figure 27
121,the secondary oocyte forms a new membrane called zona pellucida surrounding it
122,the graafian follicle now ruptures to release the secondary oocyte ovum from the ovary by the process called ovulation
123,can you figure 27 diagrammatic section view of ovary identify major differences between spermatogenesis and oogenesis
124,a diagrammatic representation of spermatogenesis and oogenesis is given below figure 28
125,a b figure 28 schematic representation of a spermatogenesis b oogenesis 24 m c enstrual ycle 33 the reproductive cycle in the female primates eg
126,monkeys apes and human beings is called menstrual cycle
127,the first menstruation begins at puberty and is called menarche
128,in human females menstruation is repeated at an average interval of about 2829 days and the cycle of events starting from one menstruation till the next one is called the menstrual cycle
129,one ovum is released ovulation during the middle rationalised 202324
130,biology figure 29 diagrammatic presentation of various events during a menstrual cycle of each menstrual cycle
131,the major events of the menstrual cycle are shown in figure 29
132,the cycle starts with the menstrual phase when menstrual flow occurs and it lasts for 35 days
133,the menstrual flow results due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus and its blood vessels which forms liquid that comes out through vagina
134,menstruation only occurs if the released ovum is not fertilised
135,lack of menstruation may be indicative of pregnancy
136,however it may also be 34 caused due to some other underlying causes like stress poor health etc
137,the menstrual phase is followed by the follicular phase
138,during this phase the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a fully mature graafian follicle and simultaneously the endometrium of uterus regenerates through proliferation
139,these changes in the ovary and the uterus are induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones figure 29
140,the secretion of rationalised 202324
141,human reproduction gonadotropins lh and fsh increases gradually during the follicular menstrual hygiene phase and stimulates follicular development as well as secretion of estrogens by the growing follicles
142,both lh and fsh attain a peak level maintenance of in the middle of cycle about 14th day
143,rapid secretion of lh leading to hygiene and sanitation during menstruation is its maximum level during the midcycle called lh surge induces rupture very important
144,take of graafian follicle and thereby the release of ovum ovulation
145,the bath and clean yourself ovulation ovulatory phase is followed by the luteal phase during which regulary
146,use sanitary napkins or clean the remaining parts of the graafian follicle transform as the corpus homemade pads
147,luteum figure 29
148,the corpus luteum secretes large amounts of change sanitary progesterone which is essential for maintenance of the endometrium
149,napkins or homemade such an endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised pads after every 45 hrs as per the requirement
150,ovum and other events of pregnancy
151,during pregnancy all events of dispose of the used the menstrual cycle stop and there is no menstruation
152,in the absence sanitary napkins of fertilisation the corpus luteum degenerates
153,this causes disintegration properly wrapping it with a used paper
154,do of the endometrium leading to menstruation marking a new cycle
155,in not throw the used human beings menstrual cycles ceases around 50 years of age that is napkins in the termed as menopause
156,cyclic menstruation is an indicator of normal drainpipe of toilets or reproductive phase and extends between menarche and menopause
157,in the open area
158,after handling the napkin wash hands with soap
159,25 fertilisation and implantation during copulation coitus semen is released by the penis into the vagina insemination
160,the motile sperms swim rapidly pass through the cervix enter into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the fallopian tube figure 211b
161,the ovum released by the ovary is also transported to the ampullary region where fertilisation takes place
162,fertilisation can only occur if the ovum and sperms are transported simultaneously to the ampullary region
163,this is the reason why not all copulations lead to fertilisation and pregnancy
164,the process of fusion of a sperm with an ovum is called fertilisation
165,during fertilisation a sperm comes in contact with the zona pellucida layer of the ovum figure 210 and induces changes in the membrane that block the entry of additional sperms
166,thus 35 35 it ensures that only one sperm can fertilise an ovum
167,the secretions of the acrosome help the sperm enter into the cytoplasm of the ovum through the zona pellucida and the plasma figure 210 ovum surrounded by few sperms rationalised 202324
168,biology membrane
169,this induces the completion of the meiotic division of the secondary oocyte
170,the second meiotic division is also unequal and results in the formation of a second polar body and a haploid ovum ootid
171,soon the haploid nucleus of the sperms and that of the ovum fuse together to form a diploid zygote
172,how many chromosomes will be there in the zygote
173,one has to remember that the sex of the baby has been decided at this stage itself
174,let us see how
175,as you know the chromosome pattern in the human female is xx and that in the male is xy
176,therefore all the haploid gametes ova produced by the female have the sex chromosome x whereas in the male gametes sperms the sex chromosome could be either x or y hence 50 per cent of sperms carry the x chromosome while the other 50 per cent carry the y
177,after fusion of the male and female gametes the zygote would carry either xx or xy depending on whether the sperm carrying x or y fertilised the ovum
178,the zygote carrying xx would develop into a female baby and xy would form a male you will learn more about the chromosomal patterns in chapter 5
179,that is why scientifically it is correct to say that the sex of the baby is determined by the father and not by the mother
180,the mitotic division starts as the zygote moves through the isthmus of the oviduct called cleavage towards the uterus figure 211 and forms 2 4 8 16 daughter cells called blastomeres
181,the embryo with 8 to 16 36 figure 211 transport of ovum fertilisation and passage of growing embryo through fallopian tube rationalised 202324
182,human reproduction blastomeres is called a morula figure 211e
183,the morula continues to divide and transforms into blastocyst figure 211g as it moves further into the uterus
184,the blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called trophoblast and an inner group of cells attached to trophoblast called the inner cell mass
185,the trophoblast layer then gets attached to the endometrium and the inner cell mass gets differentiated as the embryo
186,after attachment the uterine cells divide rapidly and covers the blastocyst
187,as a result the blastocyst becomes embedded in the endometrium of the uterus figure 211 step h
188,this is called implantation and it leads to pregnancy
189,26 p e d regnancy and mbryonic evelopment after implantation fingerlike projections appear on the trophoblast called chorionic villi which are surrounded by the uterine tissue and maternal blood
190,the chorionic villi and uterine tissue become interdigitated with each other and jointly form a structural and functional unit between developing embryo foetus and maternal body called placenta figure 212
191,the placenta facilitate the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the embryo and also removal of carbon dioxide and excretorywaste materials produced by the embryo
192,the placenta is connected to the embryo through an umbilical cord which helps in the transport of substances to and from the embryo
193,placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and produces several hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin hcg human placental lactogen hpl estrogens progestogens etc
194,in the later phase of pregnancy a hormone called relaxin is also secreted by the ovary
195,let us remember that hcg hpl and relaxin are produced in women only during pregnancy
196,in addition during pregnancy the levels of other hormones like estrogens progestogens cortisol prolactin thyroxine etc are increased several folds in the maternal blood
197,increased production of these hormones is essential for supporting the fetal growth 37 metabolic changes in the mother and maintenance of pregnancy
198,immediately after implantation the inner cell mass embryo differentiates figure 212 the human foetus within the uterus rationalised 202324
199,biology into an outer layer called ectoderm and an inner layer called endoderm
200,a mesoderm soon appears between the ectoderm and the endoderm
201,these three layers give rise to all tissues organs in adults
202,it needs to be mentioned here that the inner cell mass contains certain cells called stem cells which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs
203,what are the major features of embryonic development at various months of pregnancy
204,the human pregnancy lasts 9 months
205,do you know for how many months pregnancy last in dogs elephants cats
206,find out
207,in human beings after one month of pregnancy the embryos heart is formed
208,the first sign of growing foetus may be noticed by listening to the heart sound carefully through the stethoscope
209,by the end of the second month of pregnancy the foetus develops limbs and digits
210,by the end of 12 weeks first trimester most of the major organ systems are formed for example the limbs and external genital organs are well developed
211,the first movements of the foetus and appearance of hair on the head are usually observed during the fifth month
212,by the end of about 24 weeks end of second trimester the body is covered with fine hair eyelids separate and eyelashes are formed
213,by the end of nine months of pregnancy the foetus is fully developed and is ready for delivery
214,27 parturition and lactation the average duration of human pregnancy is about 9 months which is called the gestation period
215,vigorous contraction of the uterus at the end of pregnancy causes expulsiondelivery of the foetus
216,this process of delivery of the foetus childbirth is called parturition
217,parturition is induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism
218,the signals for parturition originate from the fully developed foetus and the placenta which induce mild uterine contractions called foetal ejection reflex
219,this triggers release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary
220,oxytocin acts on the uterine muscle and causes stronger uterine contractions which in turn stimulates further secretion of oxytocin
221,the stimulatory reflex between the uterine contraction and oxytocin secretion continues resulting in stronger and stronger contractions
222,this leads to expulsion of the baby out of the uterus through the birth canal parturition
223,soon after the infant is delivered the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus
224,what do you think the doctors inject to induce delivery
225,the mammary glands of the female undergo differentiation during pregnancy and starts producing milk towards the end of pregnancy by 38 the process called lactation
226,this helps the mother in feeding the new born
227,the milk produced during the initial few days of lactation is called colostrum which contains several antibodies absolutely essential to develop resistance for the newborn babies
228,breastfeeding during the initial period of infant growth is recommended by doctors for bringing up a healthy baby
229,rationalised 202324
230,human reproduction summary humans are sexually reproducing and viviparous
231,the male reproductive system is composed of a pair of testes the male sex accessory ducts and the accessory glands and external genitalia
232,each testis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules and each lobule contains one to three highly coiled seminiferous tubules
233,each seminiferous tubule is lined inside by spermatogonia and sertoli cells
234,the spermatogonia undergo meiotic divisions leading to sperm formation while sertoli cells provide nutrition to the dividing germ cells

247,the reproductive cycle of female primates is called menstrual cycle
248,menstrual cycle starts only after attaining sexual maturation puberty
249,during ovulation only one ovum is released per menstrual cycle
250,the cyclical changes in the ovary and the uterus during menstrual cycle are induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones
251,after coitus sperms are transported to the ampulla where the sperm fertilises the ovum leading to formation of a diploid zygote
252,the presence of x or y chromosome in the sperm determines the sex of the embryo
253,the zygote undergoes repeated mitotic division to form a blastocyst which is implanted in the uterus resulting in pregnancy
