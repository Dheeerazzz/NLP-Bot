He ran fast and reached the bus-stop in a few minutes. He was breathing rapidly. His grandmother asked him why he was breathing so fast. Boojho told her that he came running all the way. But the question got stuck in his mind. He wondered why running makes a person breathe faster. The answer to Boojhoâ€™s question lies in understanding why we breathe. Breathing is a part of respiration. Let us learn about respiration.",

The food has stored energy, which is released during respiration. Therefore, all living organisms respire to get energy from food. During breathing, we breathe in air.

When breakdown of glucose occurs with the use of oxygen, it is called aerobic respiration. Food can also be broken down without using oxygen. This is called anaerobic respiration.

Acetyl-CoA, derived from the breakdown of glucose, enters the cycle and undergoes a series of transformations, releasing carbon dioxide and high-energy electrons. These electrons are then used in the electron transport chain to generate ATP. The Krebs cycle serves as a crucial link between glycolysis and the electron transport chain in aerobic respiration.",
